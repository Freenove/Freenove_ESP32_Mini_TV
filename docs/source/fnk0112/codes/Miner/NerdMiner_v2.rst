NerdMiner_v2 (Freenove Miner)
##############################################################################

This project utilizes Freenove ESP32 Mini TV and NerdMiner_v2 to implement Bitcoin mining. It requires some programming background and a basic understanding of digital currencies.

Project Introduction
****************************************

NerdMiner_v2 (https://github.com/BitMaker-hub/NerdMiner_v2)is an excellent open-source BTC mining firmware designed for ESP32 development boards. Its goal is to allow users to experience the process of "mining a Bitcoin block" using a small piece of hardware. The primary aim of this project is to help more people learn about cryptocurrency mining while owning an aesthetically pleasing desktop accessory.

NerdMiner_v2 supports mining on **solo pools** by implementing the **Stratum protocol** (by default, it connects to **public-pool.io**, which supports Nerdminer devices, but the pool address can be customized). Freenove has ported this project to run on the Freenove ESP32 Mini TV.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of running the project on the Freenove ESP32 Mini TV.

Precautions
**************************************

* Cost

  - As of the time of writing this document, NerdMiner_v2 is temporarily free to use.

* Security Precautions  

  - Never disclose your wallet's private key or recovery phrase to anyone. The only information you need to provide is your public cryptocurrency receiving address.

* Troubleshooting  
  
  - If you have followed the tutorial but are still unable to use the miner, please feel free to contact us for assistance. (support@freenove.com)

Compatibility Description
**************************************

At the time of writing this guide, the Freenove ESP32 Mini TV is available in five different models. Although they vary in terms of screen drivers, resolutions, and screen sizes, all of them can be set up using this tutorial to learn how to use NerdMiner_v2.

The official firmware of NerdMiner_v2 is not fully compatible with this product. Therefore, Freenove has conducted secondary development based on it to ensure stable operation.
