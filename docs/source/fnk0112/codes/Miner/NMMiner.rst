##############################################################################

This project utilizes Freenove ESP32 Mini TV and NMMiner to implement Bitcoin mining. It requires some programming background and a basic understanding of digital currencies.

Project Introduction
****************************************

NMMiner (https://github.com/NMminer1024/NMMiner) is an excellent BTC mining firmware specifically designed for ESP32 development boards. It breaks away from the traditional mining requirements of massive electricity consumption and high hash rates by adopting a SOLO mining mode. In this mode, every computation has the chance to independently win the entire block reward. NMMiner supports all cryptocurrencies based on the SHA256d algorithm, such as BTC, BCH, XEC, and DGB. Freenove has successfully ported this project to run on the Freenove ESP32 Mini TV. 

This tutorial will guide you through the process of running the project on the Freenove ESP32 Mini TV.

NMMiner offers two management tools: 

1. NMController Client: Windows desktop application

2. NMController Web: A cross-platform web client designed with Python, compatible with both Windows and macOS systems.

Precautions
****************************************

* Cost
  
  - NMMiner is currently a paid service. Each device requires a unique license for activation. Therefore, you will need to purchase a separate activation code for every development board you plan to use in order to complete the activation process.

* Security Precautions  

  - Never disclose your wallet's private key or recovery phrase to anyone. The only information you need to provide is your public cryptocurrency receiving address.

* Troubleshooting

  - If you have followed the tutorial but are still unable to use the miner, please feel free to contact us for assistance. (support@freenove.com)

Compatibility Description
****************************************

At the time of writing this guide, the Freenove ESP32 Mini TV is available in five different models. Although they vary in terms of screen drivers, resolutions, and screen sizes, all of them can be set up using this tutorial to learn how to use NMMiner.
